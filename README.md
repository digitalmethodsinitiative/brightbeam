# Brightbeam

Brightbeam is a continuation/fork of Mozilla Lightbeam, a Firefox extension made to "help users understand the array of 
first and third party companies people interact with every day across the Web".

While active, it keeps track of what sites you visit, and what external content those sites load. Known trackers can be
identified and the aggregate data can be exported to study with external tools like [Gephi](https://gephi.org/).

Lightbeam was discontinued by Mozilla in 2017. Because its functionality is quite useful for people who wish to research
trackers (rather than block them), Brightbeam seeks to build upon Lightbeam to offer functionality specifically for that
purpose.

## Installation
Brightbeam is currently in development. At some point we will provide an .xpi file you can install: until then, you can
check out the git repository and 
[run it from the Firefox debugging console](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAM78GU4P34&feature=emb_title).

## Credits & license
Brightbeam was developed on top Lightbeam by Stijn Peeters for the
